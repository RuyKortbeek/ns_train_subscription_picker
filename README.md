# NS Train Subscription Picker

Because train fares in the Netherlands are bloody expensive!
The "NS" (National Dutch railway company) offers a shitload of options to get discounts; it is a mess and hard to find out which one is best (-> cheapest) for your typical behaviour.  

Script to pick the cheapest train subscription option for your travels depending on:
1) The times a week you travel
2) Wheter you travel during peak or off-peak hours

# Ideas for further improvement

### When is my subscription the cheapest?
If given the distance and subscription, how many times do I need to travel with my subscription that it is the cheapest one?
