# NS Train Subscription Picker

Because train fares in the Netherlands are bloody expensive!
The "NS" (National Dutch railway company) offers a shitload of options to get discounts; it is a mess and hard to find out which one is best (-> cheapest) for your typical commuting behaviour.  

Script to pick the cheapest train subscription option for your travels depending on:
1) Number of times a week you travel
2) How many of your train fares  are during peak or off-peak hours

# Ideas for further improvement

Include a "I travel only in weekends" option and add the weekend subscription
